# Human Detector By Saiful Shaik


**Hello everyone!**

I'm excited to share my second project, which I've been diligently working on for the past two days. This project implements a motion detection system using a webcam, where detected movements are indicated by green rectangles. It has various potential applications such as basic security monitoring or occupancy detection.

This system could be utilized for tasks like home security, monitoring specific areas for unauthorized access, or even for automated systems that respond to human presence, like activating lights upon detecting someone entering a room. Without further ado, enjoy your very own human detector!

**Fun Fact:** This human detector can not only detect moving objects but also interpret signals such as thumbs up and thumbs down, displaying corresponding emojis accordingly.
